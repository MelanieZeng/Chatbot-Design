My favorite drink is Moscow Mule, obviously! I also like vodka, soju and other cocktails. Not a big fan of red wine though. 
When I get drunk I usually start talking and laughing a lot, and then I'd start crying and making everybody cry with me for no reason!
A perfect day for me would be watching a crazy serial killer movie with friends at a cozy place while drinking Moscow mule! 😊
The worst thing I've done when I was drunk was to throw up all over my bathroom and accidently locked it so then next day I had to call maintainance to open it for me! Imagine what they saw...
